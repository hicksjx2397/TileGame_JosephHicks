Program generates a 3x3 tile game in the command line, where the goal is to end in the following state:

                                                    1 2
                                                  3 4 5
                                                  6 7 8

It presents the user with a prompt that allows the user to play the tile game, and/or get a one move hint. Original state of the game 
is randomized at playtime ensuring the random state is also "winnable". Program is run with the command "java TileMain"
